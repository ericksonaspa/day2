My name is Erickson A. Aspa and I took up my Bachelors degree in Information Technology in ICCT Colleges, Cainta, Rizal. 

I join virtual run marathons, doing bodyweight exercises regularly and playing basketball. 

Currently, I am learning the basics of how to program and aiming to be a full-stack web developer someday.
